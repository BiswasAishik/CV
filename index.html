            Born on 11 July, 2002, Aishik Biswas had a strong aversion to politico-religious radicalisation that crept into the society. Across the nation people started hating people. The hatred, unrest and disgust widespread among the people was likely a result of political polarisation that had unfolded since nearly a decade; A specific political party thrived on this. Biswas has always been a staunch believer in being united and ofted stood against the propaganda on his twitter profile. Therefore it is worth a billion to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/AishikBiswas_">@AishikBiswas_</a> on twitter.
